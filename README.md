	}
	```

## Usage
* Just use SSLoadingButton where you want button.

	```kotlin
        var submitButtonState by remember { mutableStateOf(SSButtonState.IDLE) }
        SSJetPackComposeProgressButton(
            type = SSButtonType.CLOCK,
            width = 300.dp,
            height = 50.dp,
            onClick = {
                //Perform action on click of button and make it state to LOADING
                submitButtonState = SSButtonState.LOADING
            },
            assetColor = Color.Red,
            buttonState = submitButtonState
        )
	```
	```kotlin
	    // On Success change submitButtonState to success state
        submitButtonState = SSButtonState.SUCCESS
	```
	```kotlin
        // On Failure change submitButtonState to failure state
        submitButtonState = SSButtonState.FAILIURE
	```
